# Carbon
`Carbon` is a modular C project designed to **measure the energy consumption** of a program and **estimate its carbon footprint**, based on the local energy mix (provided in JSON format). It offers a more comprehensive view of performance than traditional tools like `time`, by addressing not only execution time but also **environmental impact**.

## Motivation

When benchmarking software, developers commonly use the `time` command to measure runtime. While useful, this measure alone is **incomplete**: it tells us **how long** a program runs, but says nothing about **how much energy** it consumes or **how polluting** that energy is.

In this project, we aim to go further:
- Provide **real energy usage measurements**, from sources like RAPL (for CPU) and cgroups.
- Estimate the **CO₂ emissions** using a configurable energy mix.
- **Raise awareness** about the ecological impact of computing.

We believe it's time to shift perspective: 
> Instead of asking "how fast is my program?", we should ask:  
> "Is it energy-efficient?" and "What is its environmental cost?"

## Why it matters

Digital tools consume real energy — and depending on how that energy is produced, the ecological footprint can vary dramatically. In an age of climate urgency, developers must become conscious of:
- The impact of inefficient code.
- The benefit of **running fewer, smarter jobs** rather than brute-forcing.
- The ecological value of **efficient, low-level languages like C** that can do more with less.

Using this tool, we hope to encourage:
- Responsible coding habits.
- Better trade-offs between performance and sustainability.
- A culture of ecological awareness in the developer community.

## Features

- CPU energy measurement via **RAPL** (Intel)
- Optional GPU usage stub via **NVML**
- CPU tracking with **cgroups**
- CO₂ estimation based on user-provided **energy mix**
- Modular architecture for easy extension

## Usage

### Build

```bash
make           # Build the main executable
make test      # Build unit tests
make clean     # Clean compiled files
```
